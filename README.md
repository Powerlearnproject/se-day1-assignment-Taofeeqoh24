# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the use of engineering principle, method and tools to develop solutions to real life problems. 
importance include creation of software apps, web apps e.g Google, mobile apps e.g. access bank app, IG, Twitter and IoT e.g. Apple watch


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of Programming Languages e.g. Fotran, C
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
Advent of structured programming in 1970's
Rise of Agile Methodologies in the 2000's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement: Gathering and Documentation of user's solution
Design: high level design and detailed design of the user interface
Impementation: Writing code and building the software according to the software specification
Testing: Conducting various test to ensure quality standard
Deployment: Relating to users
Maintenance: supports and enhancement after deployiny to users

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile both approach and respond to changes

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Development: Writing code and Implemeting solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures quality
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is use for writting, debugging and testing code e.g. VS Code, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA
VCS are used to track changes to source code and cordinate work e.g. GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines, Changing requirements and Technical debts are common challenges faced by SE
Strategies to overcome include efective communication, prioritization of tasks and regular assesment of goals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: testing individual components
Integration: testing interaction between different components
System: testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is all about crafting questions to get best possible responses from AI Model
Importance of prompt enginnering is to give the best instruction to a smart assistant


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: Tell me about Dogs
Improved Prompt: Tell me about the breeds of dogs and their lifespan each
the Improved prompt is more specific and the AI Model will answer the best response
